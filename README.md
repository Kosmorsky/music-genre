# Predicting Song Genre
Using supervised learning to predict song genre at up to 99% accuracy with musical attributes fetched from Spotifyâ€™s API along with supporting data from MusicBrainz.

## Note
This was my first machine learning project. In it, I fetched a bunch of songs and their musical features from Spotify's API and used that data to predict the songs' genre.

I only wanted to include actual music in the model, so one of the biggest challenges was filtering out podcasts, movie monologues, stand-up comedy and other non-musical tracks in Spotofy's database.

To improve the model, I also imported artists' country data from muzicbrainz.com, which ended up increasing accuracy by about 10%!
